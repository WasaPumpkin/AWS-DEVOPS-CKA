      <h1 class="question">
        A company wants to migrate its content sharing web application hosted on Amazon EC2 to a serverless
        architecture. The company currently deploys changes to its application by creating a new Auto Scaling group of
        EC2 instances and a new Elastic Load Balancer, and then shifting the traffic away using an Amazon Route 53
        weighted routing policy.
        For its new serverless application, the company is planning to use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The
        company will need to update its deployment processes to work with the new application. It will also need to
        retain the ability to test new features on a small number of users before rolling the features out to the entire
        user base.
        Which deployment strategy will meet these requirements?

        A company's application is currently deployed to a single AWS Region. Recently, the company opened a new office
