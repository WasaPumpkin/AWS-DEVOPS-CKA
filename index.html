      <h1 class="question">
        A company wants to migrate its content sharing web application hosted on Amazon EC2 to a serverless
        architecture. The company currently deploys changes to its application by creating a new Auto Scaling group of
        EC2 instances and a new Elastic Load Balancer, and then shifting the traffic away using an Amazon Route 53
        weighted routing policy.
        For its new serverless application, the company is planning to use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The
        company will need to update its deployment processes to work with the new application. It will also need to
        retain the ability to test new features on a small number of users before rolling the features out to the entire
        user base.
        Which deployment strategy will meet these requirements?

        A company's application is currently deployed to a single AWS Region. Recently, the company opened a new office

      <h1 class="question">A company provides an application to customers. The application has an Amazon API Gateway REST API that invokes an AWS Lambda function. On initialization, the Lambda function loads a large amount of data from an Amazon DynamoDB table. The data load process results in long cold-start times of 8-10 seconds. The DynamoDB table has DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) configured.</h1>
      <h1 class="question">Customers report that the application intermittently takes a long time to respond to requests. The application receives thousands of requests throughout the day. In the middle of the day, the application experiences 10 times more requests than at any other time of the day. Near the end of the day, the application's request volume decreases to 10% of its normal total.</h1>
      <h1 class="question">A DevOps engineer needs to reduce the latency of the Lambda function at all times of the day.</h1>
      <h1 class="question">Which solution will meet these requirements?</h1>
      <label for="optionA">A. Configure provisioned concurrency on the Lambda function with a concurrency value of 1. Delete the DAX cluster for the DynamoDB table.</label>

      <h1 class="question">A company is adopting AWS CodeDeploy to automate its application deployments for a Java-Apache Tomcat application with an Apache Webserver. The development team started with a proof of concept, created a deployment group for a developer environment, and performed functional tests within the application. After completion, the team will create additional deployment groups for staging and production.</h1>
      <h1 class="question">The current log level is configured within the Apache settings, but the team wants to change this configuration dynamically when the deployment occurs, so that they can set different log level configurations depending on the deployment group without having a different application revision for each group.</h1>

      <label for="optionA">A. Tag the Amazon EC2 instances depending on the deployment group. Then place a script into the application revision that calls the metadata service and the EC2 API to identify which deployment group the instance is part of.
